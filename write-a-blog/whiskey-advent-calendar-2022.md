## Day 1 - Cameronbridge 27yr Old

Smells quite sweet, little hint of acetone. If anything it smells.. young? But that's strange because it's 27yrs old. At a stretch maybe I get cakey notes, croissant, danish, miscellaneous bakery aromas.

On first taste it's powerful and assertive. It's got a rum-ness to it - maybe mollasses, brown sugar? It's got a rich dark fruits flavour that borders on medicinal, not soft like a port, but a similar flavour profile. Plums? More than a hint of aniseed. It's really growing on me as I drink it.

A bit of a departure from the Islay and Ryes that I tend to like, but tasty. 

> Assertive, sweet, and slightly medicinal. Plenty to expore past the first sip. Could be a little more gentle for the age. 68/100.
