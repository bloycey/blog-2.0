## Day 1 - Cameronbridge 27yr Old

Smells quite sweet, little hint of acetone. If anything it smells.. young? But that's strange because it's 27yrs old. At a stretch maybe I get cakey notes, croissant, danish, miscellaneous bakery aromas.

On first taste it's powerful and assertive. It's got a rum-ness to it - maybe mollasses, brown sugar? It's got a rich dark fruits flavour that borders on medicinal, not soft like a port, but a similar flavour profile. Plums? More than a hint of aniseed. It's really growing on me as I drink it.

A bit of a departure from the Islay and Ryes that I tend to like, but tasty. 

> Assertive, sweet, and slightly medicinal. Plenty to expore past the first sip. Could be a little more gentle for the age. 68/100.

## Day 2 - Teerenpeli 3yr Old

I was at a board games night so I couldn't take the time to do a full tasting. This one didn't blow me away. Had a farmyardy type smell. Flavour was fairly non-descript and I struggled to nail down specific flavours. It wasn't peaty or oaky or anything - most noticable was the ethanol burn. Aftertaste of burnt rubber. Started off rough, smoothed out a bit, and then finished rough again. Can't expect too much at 3yrs old and despite my negative critique there was enough there that I'd be interested to try an older age statement to see the difference it makes.

> Young, rough, and no real character. 36/100
